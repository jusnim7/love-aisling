            Chosing the person that you want to share your life with is one of the most important decisions someone can make.
            And I want you to know why that I want to share my life with you. You have been, for the last months, my first and last thought of the day, and you still are.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>I love that you care</strong>
                I fell for you because... of your incredible empathy. 
                The way you care for others is something I deeply admire. 
                You can tell a person's heart by how they treat those around them, and your kindness shines through in everything you do. 
                You’re someone anyone can count on in difficult times, and I know you would never intentionally hurt me because your heart is filled with genuine love. 
                That’s one of the many reasons I’m so grateful to have you in my life
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>I love how you see life</strong> 
                I fell for you because... I really admire the way you see the world. 
                You have this amazing outlook on life, always wanting to make the most of it, and that’s something I want to be a part of. 
                Being with you made me realize that life is short, and living for someone you love is such a powerful act of love.
                I want to live for you, to do my best every day to make you as happy as you already make me.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>I love that you trusted me</strong>
                I fell for you because... you made me feel special. 
                I know you've been through a tough relationship, and it left you heartbroken. 
                Despite that, you still chose to open up to me about how you feel about love, and I really appreciate that. 
                It means a lot that you trust me with your feelings, and I’m grateful for the chance to be a part of your life.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>I love your company</strong>
                I fell for you because... I really enjoyed spending time together. 
                I think one of the most important things in a relationship is being friends first, and I loved all the days we spent just getting to know each other. 
                Hearing about your life, your family, your dreams, even your favorite songs and ice cream flavors—it all made me love you more. 
                I fell for you because I got to know you as a person first, and that’s what made everything so special.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <strong>I love how you make me feel</strong> 
                I fell for you because... you're a much better person than I am. 
                You're smart, empathetic, loving, kind, strong, beautiful, and funny (though I think you're still working on that last one). 
                Just kidding, you're actually really funny.
                You're everything I want to be with, and everything I want to be for. 
                You're everything I hope to have in my life, now and for the rest of it.
